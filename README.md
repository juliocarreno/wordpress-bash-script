# wordpress-bash-script
This is a simple bash script that allows you to create a simple structure of a wordpress theme.

If you use GNU/Linux to delevop Wordpress themes then this might be useful for you.

## Use
In order to use this script I recommend to copying it to the /usr/local/bin folder, or to your executable folder. 

This script needs a 744 permission to work.

The command is simple. Just go to the themes folder of your Wordpress installation and then in your terminal write **_wordpress new themename_**.
That's it, you'll get a new wordpress theme file structure to work with.
